# Hello Everyone  :wave:
I'm Onur Emren. I am at first year computer programming student :clipboard:. My software trainings and projects date back to earlier times. I have been taking trainings and developing mobile applications since 2020. You can review my sample projects and give me feedback :warning: . Besides Kotlin, I also started to produce Swift projects.

## My Swift Projects :iphone: :

**Calculate Note 1**

CalculateNote, my first application on the AppStore, was developed for Turkish and English teachers. With this application, you can get and save the average of exam scores with a single click. The application is available free of charge and without advertising.
